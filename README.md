# Web-Script Programming
## Coursework Challenge 1

Welcome to the first coursework for the Web Script Programming unit.  This folder contains all the challenges that you must try to complete.

This is an individual coursework, so whilst you are allowed to discuss both the challenges _and_ the approaches you might take to tackling them, all work must be your own.

Unit tests are in the same format that you have completed week on week.  For this cousework they're in the file `assess.js`.

To run the unit tests you should open `index.html`, as usual.

## Submission / Upload
When you have completed all the tests to the best of your ability, upload your `index.js` file to the dropbox on moodle.
